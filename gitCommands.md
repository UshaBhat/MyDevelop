># 1. add
* The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. 
* It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.

> git add (options)




># 2. checkout
* The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch . Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.

> git checkout (options)



># 3. clone
* git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine accessible supported protocols. The git clone command copies an existing Git repository.

># 4. commit
*  Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory. This only includes modifications to tracked files (those that have been added with git add at some point in their history). git commit -m "commit message" A shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message.

> git commit (options)



># 5. config
* Define the author name to be used for all commits by the current user.
* Define the author email to be used for all commits by the current user.

> git config --global user.email <email> 
> 
> git config --global
user.name <name> 





># 6. gitignore
* A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected; see the NOTES below for details. Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern.

> .gitignore




># 7. log
* The git log command is used to view the history of committed changes within a Git repository. Each set of changes made by a developer is recorded as a commit in Git. The git log command shows a default output for quickly reviewing the commit history.

Already up to date.



># 10. gitk
* Gitk is invoked similarly to git log . Executing the gitk command will launch the Gitk UI which will look similar to the following: The upper left pane displays the commits to the repository, with the latest on top. The lower right displays the list of files impacted by the selected commit.

> gitk (options)
  


># 11. status
* The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. 
> git status
> 
> ushabhat@ushabhat-Latitude-5531:~/MyDevelop$ git status
> 
> On branch main

Current branch main is up to date.



># 14. remote
